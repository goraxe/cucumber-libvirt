cucumber-vhost
==============

This was designed and written to enable me to test code on Virtual Machines without having to worry if they were provisioned correctly

The system relies on Cobbler and Libvirt - there are a few posts on getting cobbler up and running on my blog: http://www.threedrunkensysadsonthe.net/

This software is released under the GPL, I'll add the full license text shortly.

This is not a working product yet, just the bones of one... :)
